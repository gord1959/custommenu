# custommenu
a custom menu for those who miss the taskbar.
just install and run. click run at startup and it should allways appear.
designed to organize your shortcuts. you can drag and drop shortcuts into the categories you create.
create the category then drag the shortcut into the right side box then double click to open the program.
I put it on the right side of the desktop because I didn't want it to interfere with anything else. 
you can resize it but not move it. you can change the color. 
I wrote it using visual studio on a windows 10 pc.
hope it works for you
